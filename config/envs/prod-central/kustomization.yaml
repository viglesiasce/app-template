# Customize the namespace to be the namespace name used for prod-central environment.
# This change should be made before `appcel env add prod-central`.
# Once the prod-central environment is added, the namespace shouldn't be changed.
# Note that when you customize the namespace field, you also need to change
# REDISHOST to be with the same namespace
#   REDISHOST=redis-master.<NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local

# To use a different redis host available at <HOST> with the password <PASSWORD>,
# make the following change in the current kustomization.yaml.
#
# 1. remove - ../../base/redis from the resources. The resources will be
#    resources:
#    - ../../base.app

# 2. change the configmapGenerator to use <HOST>. The configmapGenerator will be
# configmapGenerator:
# - name: redishost
#   literals:
#    - REDISHOST=<HOST>
#
# 3. uncomment the following secretGenerator:
# secretGenerator:
# - name: redis
